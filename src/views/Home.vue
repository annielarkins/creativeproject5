    <h3> Why should you convert your old tapes, slides, and photos? </h3>
    <ul> 
    <li>Video/audio tapes and slides deteriorate over time </li>
    <li>VCRâ€™s are outdated</li>
    <li>Hooking up your camcorder to your TV to watch videos is inconvenient</li>
    <li>It is hard to search videotapes for specific events or memories</li>
    <li>Slides are difficult to store and are sensitive to heat, light, dust, mold, etc.</li>
    <li>Slides can lose their image colors over time</li>
    <li>Slides are hard to organize and can only be seen through slide projectors</li>
    <li>Digital footage can be easily shared with family and friends via the internet</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Why should you use ATL Digital Media Services?</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Other companies (including Costco) send your slides and videos away to be processed. This could result in the loss of your precious memories. At the ATL Digital Media Lab, we keep your precious materials in a clean and pet-free environment for processing.</li>
    <li>ATL Digital Media Services has much lower prices than other companies.</li>
    <li>We will deliver your digital media in the form that is most convenient for you: DVD, online dropbox, flash drive, etc.</li>
    </ul>
